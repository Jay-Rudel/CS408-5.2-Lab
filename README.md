    To get started, clone this repository, and then you can learn 
    to view it in the "Viewing" section. Which is below.

    There are tests for this project so you will need to run the following command:

## Viewing
    I highly recommend using VSCode Live Server extention to see the project. This allows you to
    see the page, and interact with the page without having to open it in a local file.

    The file that you will be looking at for this project in my github is called "index.html"

    Color:
        The current colors: black text with Green background. Fails every single one of the contract checker from the following Site:https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/

        In order to fix we change the green to a more contracting color with black making it closer to white. This fixes all of the issues that were found as well.

    Semantic HTML
        1. When trying to navigate using the keyboard almost everything works besides the comment section. Which I fixed by changing from a div to a button.
        2. I changed the Font tags to h1, h2, and h3 depending on the size of the tag. If size = 6, became a h2. 
        3. I changed the div element in <div class="nav"> to a <nav> element also fixing the CSS to represent that.

    The Images
    The Audio Player:

## References / If needed
    The only source I used for this project was the
    reading that was provided to us. Just to make sure
    I could figure out how to do the nav bar. As that was
    what I had problems coding.
